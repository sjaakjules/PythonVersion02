'''
Purpose: Interprets card rule text and enforces complex or undefined rules.
Responsibilities:
	•	Parses keywords (e.g. "Genesis", "Voidwalk") and attaches passive/triggered/activated logic.
	•	Prompts the user to define custom behavior if rules are undefined or ambiguous (The Golden Rule: "use common sense and be cool" ).
	•	Maintains a lookup table of resolved abilities and their effects.
	•	Manages insertion of triggered events into the Storyline system.
	•	Enforces rule timing: non-active player places triggered events first, player priority, and event resolution
